                [Eph 6:18 KJV] Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
              </blockquote>
              <p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/6/18/s_1103018" target="_blank">Ephesians 6:18</a> reminds us that prayer is our heavy artillery in the spirtual war against the powers of darkness. Artillery commanders know they have to be very precises
                  with their target commands, otherwise they risk friendly fire causalties. Similarly, prayer should be singularly specific. Use names. Describe exactly the desired action
                  you would like God to take. Care about what you are praying for. Put some emotional skin in the game. We have collected several prayers here to help you get started teaching and using effective prayers.
