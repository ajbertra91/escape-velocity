We thank you for the extremes You have gone through to make us Your own and to bring us Your Word.</p> <p>We thank you for these students here today. We humbly ask You to draw them to Yourself. Plant Your seed of faith in their hearts and cultivate it now and forever. Draw them close to You in body, mind, soul, and heart so that they may truly love You completely. Please author and perfect their faith as you have promised to do. We thank You for the teachers here today, that You have called to Your service. Bless them with Your Spirit so that they may teach Your Word with certainty, love, and compassion. Help them to build up these students to be men and women of God. So, they may be prepared for all the attacks the enemy can muster.</p> <p>We pray these petitions in the name of our Messiah and King, Jesus.</br>Amen.</p>",
