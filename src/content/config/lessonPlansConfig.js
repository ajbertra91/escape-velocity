                    comment: "<strong>Explain:</strong> This is most apparent when watching almost any prime time drama on TV these days. The greatest good is to save a life no matter what rules (ethics) the characters have to break in order to achieve that good goal. Writers like to juxtapose character's opinions against the laws or societal 'norms' to make the point that one or the other is better because the writer says so."
